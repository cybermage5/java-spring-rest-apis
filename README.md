# User management by using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL
Here's a step-by-step guide to building REST APIs using the Java Spring framework with PostgreSQL for the specified endpoints:

## 1. Set Up Your Spring Boot Project

### Create a New Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create a new project.
Choose the following dependencies:
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Driver

### Configure the application.properties:

## 2. Create the User Entity

## 3. Create the User Repository

## 4. Create the User Service

## 5. Create the User Controller

## 6. Run Your Application
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the database is created.
- Run your Spring Boot application.
- Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.

## 7. Test Your API
- GET /users: Retrieve all users.
- GET /user/{id}: Retrieve a user by ID.
- POST /user: Create a new user.
- PUT /user: Update an existing user.
- DELETE /user/{id}: Delete a user by ID.
